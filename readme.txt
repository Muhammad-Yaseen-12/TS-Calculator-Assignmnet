I have built a calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, combining the power of these technologies to create a smooth and interactive user experience. The UI is designed with CSS for a clean and modern look, while JavaScript and TypeScript handle the logic behind calculations, ensuring efficiency and type safety.

This calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The TypeScript integration makes the code more structured and error-free, enhancing maintainability. With a responsive design, it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Overall, this project showcases my front-end development skills, demonstrating my ability to combine multiple technologies to build functional and user-friendly applications. ðŸš€
